1. What is Encapsulation? Try to list out the benefits of Encapsulation.

Encapsulation is a way to hide internal data from the other class which can access it. We can declare the variables of a class by using private to do data hiding.

The benefits of Encapsulation as below:
1.It's a shield of hiding information to keep secured.
2.Prevent the other user to change hided dataa automatically.


2. Try to explain what enum is and why we use them.

Enumeration is a named list of constants and enum constants are objects of enum class type.

Here are the reason why we use enum:
1.Improve readability
2.The constant value can be changed at anytime


3. How to use enum in Kotlin? Attach a sample code that uses enum in Kotlin.

We can initialize data class in Kotlin, a sample code can be refered as below:

enum class Color{
RED,
WHITE,
BLACK,
GREEN
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
println("Amiya = "  + Color.RED.ordinal)
println("Closure = " + Color.WHITE.ordinal)
println("Blaze = " + Color.BLACK.ordinal)
println("Rosmontis = "  + Color.GREEN.ordinal)
}
->
Amiya = 0
Closure = 1
Blaze = 2
Rosmontis = 3


4. What are the differences between LinearLayout and RelativeLayout? Try to explain in
detail.

*Linear layout can use vertically or horizontally to represent layout by aligning in a single direction.


*Relative Layout
RelativeLayout is a view group that displays child views in relative positions.
We use relative position to control component position and default child view as true or false.




5. Try to explain the benefits of ConstraintLayout. Why should you use it?

*Constraint layout is more convenient to arrange layout by dragging, dropping component and it's easier to handle complex design.

If we use linear layout, some data setting are fixed that we need to fix one by one, it's more complex.
If we use relative layout, we need to be careful of the realtionship of each component. Once we affect one component, it's possilbe of affecting the other component,
